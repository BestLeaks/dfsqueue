This is a fully fledged queue system complete with a staff post-restart grace join timer, pretty and dynamic links to discord or other places, intuitive messages using AdaptiveCards, and artificial player population limitation. It also implements prio points, and an automatic ban/ban-lift system. You can also track offline players by their ID's so long as a restart hasn't hit yet.
